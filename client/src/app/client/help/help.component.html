          No one is ever safe from the unexpected! It is normal not always to be able to respond favorably to all your requests. No problem: here's how. <br>

          1.Reject the request before it expires within 24 hours: This is important for your response rate, and is one of the factors that will allow you to become a Superhost. <br>
          2. Decide to block these dates or open them for booking to other travelers. <br>
          3. Have you changed your mind? It happens ! All you need to do is ask travelers to submit a new request, or send them a special offer or invitation to book.
          You can also decline their request for information, which prevents travelers from submitting a reservation request. </p>

          You need to feel comfortable with your travelers. If no faces appear in the photo or if it shows something else (a comic book character, for example), you can contact us to cancel without penalties.
